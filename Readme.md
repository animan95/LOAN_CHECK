#  Loan Default Risk Prediction with ML

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to **predict the probability of loan default** using real-world Lending Club data. It includes data preprocessing, model training (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost), SHAP-based explainability, and a deployable Streamlit app.

---

##  Problem Statement

Financial institutions need robust tools to assess **creditworthiness** of borrowers, especially in the absence of traditional credit scores. This project aims to:

- Predict default probability using borrower attributes
- Compare model performance across tree-based ML models
- Provide model explainability using SHAP
- Deliver an interactive app to test predictions in real-time
